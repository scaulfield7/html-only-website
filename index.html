            <h1>HTML-Only Website In Dark Mode</h1>
            <p>Hi there. You're probably wondering why I built this website using only HTML. <i>Fortunately</i>, due to the fast loading speed of HTML-only websites, you don't need to wait long to find out.</p>
            <p>Other than wanting to set myself a fun design challenge, below are the main reasons.</p>

            <h3>Why HTML?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Loads quickly</li>
                <li>Minimalist design (no distractions)</li>
                <li>Sustainable</li>
                <li>Compatible in older browsers</li>
                <li>Compatible with multiple devices</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Also, it's old school, and nostalgia is pretty <i>in</i> right now.</p>
